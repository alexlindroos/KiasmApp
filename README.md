## Change log ##

**v1.0.3**

* Demo release.

**v1.0.2**

* Started to shape the backend for our application which will now fetch and parse XML. UI is now also linked to the code and will update accordingly to the state. Application will also post the visit time back to the server.

**v1.0.1**

* Placeholders for data and maps were changed to real life objects. We decided that the application should have a supporting back end where it would get exhibition data and send users visit times.

**v1.0.0**

* In week 4 we took major steps with the project. We set up Trello workspace and started implementing Scrum to our project. We created our first data model and storyboard of views the application can detect all beacons in its proximity and show the nearest one.
